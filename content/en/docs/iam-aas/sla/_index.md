title: Service Level Agreement

The IAM service instances provided and operated by INFN may be subject to
specific SLAs to be defined with the collaborating organizations/projects. 

If no specific SLA is defined, a standard SLA applies, namely the service is
operational 24x7, with the support granted on a best-effort basis from Monday
to Friday during INFN office hours.
