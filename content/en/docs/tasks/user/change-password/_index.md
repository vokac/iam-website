title: Changing the account password
---

Once logged in you can change your account password by clicking on the "Change
password" button in your home page:

![Change password](../images/change-password.png)

Note that the "Change password" functionality is only useful if you remember
your IAM account password. In case you forgot it, logout from the IAM and
follow the instructions in the [Reset account password][reset-password]
section.

[reset-password]: ../reset-password
